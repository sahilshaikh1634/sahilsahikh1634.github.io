My name is Sahil Shaikh. I was born and raised in Shirdi,Maharashtra.

I did B.E. in Computer Science from MMIT,Pune, Pune University.(2021)

And also did Three Years Diploma in Computer Technology from Sanjivani Institute,Kopargoan.(2018)

I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.
