Aadhaar masking API is very important for every financial institution or the entities that need to store the Aadhaar of an individual as a proof of identity. Masking an Aadhaar means replacing the first eight digits of an Aadhaar number on an Aadhaar Card with some characters like “xxxx-xxxx”, such that only the last four digits of the Aadhaar Number are visible.Format Suporrted: PDF,TIF,PNG,JPEG,JPG.
