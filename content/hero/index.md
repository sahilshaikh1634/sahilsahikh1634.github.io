I'm an India based Full Stack Developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

 I am very passionate about programming and engineering as a whole. I primarily work on the backend and I am very fond of complex systems that require critical thinking skills and logic. Though, I am flexible and have worked in the frontend as well!
